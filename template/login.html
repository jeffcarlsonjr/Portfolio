        This login page being is run with AngularJS and is verified with a Login function that I build that has 3 levels to it. From here, once you have received your email with your password, you will be able to log in to view few applications that I built. That application page can not be loaded without the word login in first. You can switch out the words "login" with "applications" in the URL yourself but will be reloaded back to this page.
